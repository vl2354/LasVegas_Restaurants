<h2>Attribute Analysis</h2>
<p>We checked restaurant distribution by cuisine and impacts of selected attributes on restaurants’ price and rating range in Downtown and the Strip. Price range scale is from 1 to 4; rating range scale is from 1 to 5. We used restaurant proportion in percentage, instead of restaurant count for better comparsion, as the Strip’s restaurant total count is much higher than Downtown’s total restaurant count.</p>
